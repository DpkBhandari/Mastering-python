# Question 1 (pop())
# Start with this list
nums = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

ele = nums.pop()
print(f"Updated List : {nums}")

# Remove the last element using pop() and store it in a variable.
# Print both the updated list and the popped element.

# Expected Output:
# Updated list: [10, 20, 30, 40]
# Popped element: 50
